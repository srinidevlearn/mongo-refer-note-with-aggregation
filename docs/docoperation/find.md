## cursor
-The Cursor is a MongoDB Collection of the document which is returned upon the find method execution.

- By default, it is automatically executed as a loop. However, we can explicitly get specific index document from being returned cursor. It is just like a pointer which is pointing upon a specific index value.

-In simple words when we call a find method, all the documents which are returned are saved in a virtual cursor. If a find method returns for a document then it is mean that the cursor has 0 â€“ n index.
